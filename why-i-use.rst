================================================================================
Why I use text editors from the 1970s (a history) and why you probably shouldn't
================================================================================

Ideas for a talk.

The editors I first started using.

Emacs/XEmacs -> Vim -> Emacs/Evil mode

GUI versus terminal, remote editing *may* mean ssh and tmux, but not necessarily.

Rectangles, split views on a file, macros, what else makes a *sophisticated*
editor?


IDEs versus editors

PyCharm/IntelliJ and VisualCode (is that the right name?)
