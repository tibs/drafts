=======================
Fashions in semi-colons
=======================

In a tweet in Feburary 2020 (thread was at
https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1228346166150123521)
David MacIver asked:

  Scenario: You are given one calendar year to take a sabbatical and write a
  book. You are paid a sufficient salary to focus exclusively on it, and
  provided an editor, etc. to handle publishing, you just need to do the
  actual writing. What do you write?

And I responded:

  Given a year and a good editor, then I'd want to write an overview of the
  programming languages that seem to me to be interesting over the last 50
  years or so. There were a couple of these in the 80s/90s, which I enjoyed a
  lot.

  It would need to be very personal - there's no way to do a "proper" history
  in reasonable space, but I think there's room for "these are the things that
  happened (in programming languages) that seem interesting to me" and also
  how they relate (or don't)

  (Of course, I think a chapter on the changing fashions and meanings of
  semi-colons would be interesting, so perhaps you don't really want me to do
  this)

  Drat - now I want to write that. Drat.

I'm fairly convinced no-one would want to read this or listen to it...

* Where did their use come from? Who used them first
* Languages where a semicolon is a comment character (lisp, assembly) [nb:
  neither of those needs a traditional terminator character, but for entirely
  different reasons)
* Separator or terminator (C or Pascal)
* Required or optional
* If optional, why ever need them
* (how to tell if a line continues - strategies in BCPL, Ruby, who else?)
* If required, why
* What does the compiler do if a user misses one?
* Programming languages that use other characters (erlang, prolog)
* Rust and the meaning when a semicolon *isn't* there
